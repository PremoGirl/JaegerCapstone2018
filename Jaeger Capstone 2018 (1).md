* What is the problem you want to solve?

Home health agencies are not all created equally. Like most businesses, some are better run than others. The factors that determine this are many. When a client needs home health services, it is important to be informed as to which ones have better outcomes, depending on where the client lives and what kind of services they need. I want to solve the problem of clients being uninformed about the home health agency that they are using.** Specifically, what factors are most important to the "quality of patient care star rating"?**

* Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

Clients can be anyone who needs physical rehabilitation or who have loved ones that need physical rehabilitation in a home setting. With this analysis, clients will be able to decide based on location, services needed and outcomes which home health agency will give them the best opportunity to successfully rehabilitate. 

* What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

Data: [Home Health Compare Datasets](https://data.medicare.gov/data/home-health-compare)

Specifically: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CXv9EvPI98kTwmzhsyKKOn6N-GpSU3awr8uvlMm8GqI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CXv9EvPI98kTwmzhsyKKOn6N-GpSU3awr8uvlMm8GqI/edit?usp=sharing)

* In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

	I will compare the relationships between the variables and the quality of patient care star rating using regression lines; I will also compare home health companies to each other and look for relationships.

* What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

The code to ask the questions and find the right data to answer them.

A slide deck with the explanation of how to use this service and what the outcome will be.
